# Introduction

## The Construction Company Web App is an all-in-one platform designed to streamline project management, task tracking, and communication between clients, employees, and administrators.

The goal of the app is to:

- Provide clients with real-time visibility into project progress, files, and updates.

- Enable employees to manage their daily tasks, upload reports, and communicate efficiently.

- Give admins a centralized control panel to oversee projects, teams, and company operations.

The app combines the reliability of a traditional website with the functionality of a modern web app — offering dashboards, file management, messaging, and progress tracking accessible from any device.


# Purpose of the Project

The Web App is being developed to support and modernize the daily operations of my father’s construction company.
Currently, much of the company’s work management — such as assigning tasks, tracking project progress, sharing documents, and communicating with clients — is handled manually through phone calls, paper documents, or separate apps.

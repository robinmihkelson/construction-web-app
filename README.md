🧩 Introduction
The Pärlikee Company Web App is an all-in-one platform designed to streamline project management, task tracking, and communication between clients, employees, and administrators.

The goal of the app is to:

Provide clients with real-time visibility into project progress, files, and updates.

Enable employees to manage their daily tasks, upload reports, and communicate efficiently.

Give admins a centralized control panel to oversee projects, teams, and company operations.

The app combines the reliability of a traditional website with the functionality of a modern web app — offering dashboards, file management, messaging, and progress tracking accessible from any device.
